		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Erin Bentel. I am a avid horse lover and ride as much as I can. I have one brother, and my mom and dad, as well as five birds.
		Our whole family loves pets, and I have never been in a situation where we didn't have at least one animal. I want to be a veternarian when I grow up, and this has always been the case. I love adventuring to new places and trying new food. My favorite food is anything chocolate, but chai latte's are a close second.</p>

		<p>I have recently gotten into photograhy. It makes me so happy to be able to provide someone with a portrait of themselves that they will be able to keep forever. Because of this, I have been doing lots of senior portraits as well as horse and owner sessions.</p>
