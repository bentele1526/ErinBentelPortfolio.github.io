	<h3> Who is my favorite actress, why? </h3>
	<body> My favorite actress is Miley Cyrus. Even though she has brought up great controversy in the past years regarding  her actions, she was my childhood role model. Her show, Hannah Montana, was what I looked forward to watching everyday. For being such a young actress, she was perfect for the role and executed it greatly. I still love her outgoing personality and the fact that she is not afraid to do what she wants as she doesn't care what others think. </h3>
